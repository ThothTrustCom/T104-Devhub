## Switching On the Card ##
Access to the card's functionalities including the display of E-Wallet values requires powering up the card. The card can be switched on by **pressing and holding the Power button for about 3 seconds** before releasing the power button or until the screen refreshes.

The card may not power on if it runs out of battery. _Once the card has no more battery power, it is considered useless_.

## Switching Off the Card ##
Powering down the card can be done by **pressing and holding the Power button for about 3 seconds** before releasing the power button or until the screen switches off.

The _card should be powered down whenever not in use_ to prevent overuse of the card.

## Care for T104 ##
1. End Users should execute switching on and then switching off the card after the card has timed out with content still displayed on the screen to ensure that the card is really powered down and ensuring that no content exists on the screen.
2. End Users should periodically power on and then power off their cards to ensure that the card is in working order and that the card powers down gracefully.

## Scrolling through the E-Wallet ##
End Users may view the "Balance", "Payment" and "Loaded Funds" amount for the E-Wallet function by following the steps:
1. Power on the card.
2. Press on the Inspect button and the Wallet Inspection Indicator should point to one of the amounts that one is scrolling through to view. Keep pressing the Inspect button to cycle through the different wallet amount to view.
3. Power down the card when done.
